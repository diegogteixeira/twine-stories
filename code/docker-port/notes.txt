You're trying to set up Redis inside Docker Compose on your Mac. (maybe you're working from
your hammock)

things you could try:

1. Look at your docker-compose.yaml
2. check if Redis is running
----- docker-compose logs redis
3. ping the container
----- try 'ping redis', it doesn't work
----- google 'ping docker container on Mac', you can't do that
----- oh well
4. open a terminal inside the Python container
------ use the redis CLI to connect to Redis
------- oops it's not installed
------ redis-cli -h localhost -p 36379 keys "*" (fails)
------ redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379 keys "*" (fails)
------ redis-cli -h redis -p 36379 keys "*" (fails)
------ redis-cli -h redis -p 6379 keys "*" (works)
5. use the redis CLI to connect to Redis
------ redis-cli -h localhost -p 36379 keys "*" (works)
------ redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379 keys "*" (fails)
------ redis-cli -h redis -p 36379 keys "*" (fails)
------ redis-cli -h redis -p 6379 keys "*" (fails)


6. talk about network namespaces













things you could learn:
